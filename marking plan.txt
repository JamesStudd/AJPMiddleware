Good design
Good rationale on why we chose what we did


Weaknesses

No testing plan
Think about scalability / extensibility
Better work plan needed - deadlines


Other notes

Most, not all, activities can be locked down by blocking queue, make sure everything is going through a wait notify.
Keep the program lightweight.
